# Welcome to my Portfolio Page

This is the 3rd version of my portfolio site
Well, actually it's the 4th since the I built the 3rd and it got blown up when I merged it to main.

# Process

After my 2nd work term at NorthernLabs, I wanted to update my site since I wanted to improve on the old one.

My first portfolio site was built with pure css, then I remade it with Bootstrap

My second portfolio site was built with TailwindCSS, the styling framework that I used heavily during my time at SkyViewSuites

This one is built with MUI and I did my best to make the code as readable and organized as possible.
